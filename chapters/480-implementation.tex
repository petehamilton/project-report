\section{Feedback}\label{sec:implementation-feedback}

\subsection{Listing Mistakes}
\label{sec:feedback-listing}
\todo[inline,color=red]{Feedback Techniques - List of Issues}

- Very clear what's wrong

- Comes across negative

- Doesn't necessarily help them know what to do next time

- Easy to generate

- Didn't always mean much to the child

\subsection{Colour Coding}
\todo[inline,color=red]{Feedback Techniques - List of Issues}

- Nice and visual

- Can highlight component by component (perhaps in conjunction with \cref{sec:feedback-listing}

- Traffic Light system

- Didn't always mean much to the child

\subsection{On Screen Correction}

- Scaling, Rotation, Translation

- Animations were very clear :)

- Hard to do! Lots of potential difficulties

- Child immediately got what they'd done wrong

\subsection{Aggregation}

Bringing it all together

Given the large number of scoring results given for a manuscript drawing, some of the early testers suggested that a simple scoring system could be used like stars from 1 to 3 or 1 to 5.

To produce a simple numeric score we must somehow aggregate the more detailed feedback. For example, by assigning weights to `musical correctness', `stems', `note heads' etc, we can produce a score in a reasonable range for overall feedback in a more simplistic form.

\section{Client Application}

AngularJS framework, minimal data transfer using JSON, 

\subsection{Admin Interface}
Functional, regenerate classifiers, classify components, identify drawing mistakes for comparison to automation, look at all the drawing attempts

\subsection{Student Interface}

Easy to use, concept of lessons which only judge specific criteria, how feedback is integrated from \cref{sec:implementation-feedback}, can look at previous attempts

\section{Server Application}
Rails, makes calls to python, uses scikit-image, loads direct from postgres etc
