\chapter*{Abstract}
We present \noteED - an application that allows a child to practise their music theory and manuscript writing. The system automatically generates feedback which would otherwise require interaction with a human music teacher.

Using techniques from \emph{computer vision}, \emph{machine learning} and \emph{domain knowledge}, \noteED recognises and analyses fundamental musical symbols handwritten on a tablet. This enables generation of useful feedback to the student in order to improve their written manuscript quality whilst reinforcing the learning of concepts from fundamental music theory.

Initial studies with children suggest

show that the using the system is an effective way of getting feedback on their skills

- We can generate effective feedback
- etc

%
% Recognition of symbols both individually and in relation to each other enables useful feedback to the student in order to improve their written manuscript quality and reinforces the learning of concepts from fundamental music theory.
