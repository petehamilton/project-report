\chapter*{Abstract}
We would like to present Note\emph{ED} - an application which allows a child to practice their manuscript writing and music theory from home whilst receiving immediate feedback, outside of their music lessons.

We show that Note\emph{ED} is capable of recognising and analysing fundamental musical symbols both individually and in relation to each other and that it can do so in a way that enables useful feedback to a student, improving their written manuscript quality and reinforcing concepts from fundamental music theory.
