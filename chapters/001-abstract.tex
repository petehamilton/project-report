\chapter*{Abstract}
We would like to present Note\emph{ED} - an application which allows a child to practice their manuscript writing and music theory from home whilst receiving immediate feedback, outside of their music lessons.

In the course of the following dissertation we demonstrate that Note\emph{ED} is capable of recognising and analysing fundamental musical symbols both individually and in relation to each other and that it can do so in a way that enables useful feedback to a student in order to improve their written manuscript quality and reinforce concepts from fundamental music theory.
