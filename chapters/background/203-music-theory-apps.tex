\section{Music Theory Applications}
\label{sec:music-theory-apps}
In order to establish what kinds of applications might exist in and around this music recognition and correction field, I researched online. The Apple ``App Store'' revealed several examples of applications which teach music theory, however none of these focus on writing music and are more based around ideas like flashcards and memorisation.

Most of these apps however, are aimed at more advanced students and miss out a huge part of theory exams which is the written notation section.
