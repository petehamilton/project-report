In this paper the authors discuss the use of domain knowledge in musical classification. In general I can't rely on musical rules due to the potential mistakes which will likely be made, I can however use the excellent flow diagram which is reproduced in \cref{fig:arebelo-flow} and represents their musical extraction algorithm as a reference for the order in which musical entities could best be detected.
