\section{Classification}

Statistic (parametric and non-parametric) vs Syntactic
\subsection{Template Matching}

Used a lot by \parencite{rossant2002global}

\subsection{Normalized Cross Correlation}

\subsection{Neural Network}
Possibly drop this, I didn't use it and it rapidly decreased in effectiveness

\subsection{Nearest Neighbour}

\subsection{Modified Nearest Neighbour}

To save space, improve accuracy etc, note the issues I had with storage space, speed of classifier generation.

Just do wilson and wilson iterative
