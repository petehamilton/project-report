Hough tranforms?

Skeletonization?

\subsection{Image Difference}

If you're handling simple 1 bit images, you can perform a simple image difference which just takes the first image, XOR'd with the second. The result (shown in Figure \ref{fig:crotchet-diff}) is a simple highlighting of the difference between the two.
