\todo[inline,color=red]{Objectives - Update objectives to most recent goals}


\subsection{Indentification}

To be able to identify the following aspects of a manuscript attempt:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Symbols - The notes, rests, accidentals and other symbols which make up a musical score
  \item Pitch - For notes and accidentals, the pitch of the note they represent
  \item Duration - For notes, the duration of the note
  \item Key Signatures - Groups of accidentals representing key signatures
  \item Time Signatures - Stacked digits representing a change in tempo
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Beats and Timing}

\subsection*{Image Analysis}
Build a service which is capable of analysing a notation drawing and establishing one or more scores for multiple aspects of a notation attempt based on a reference example and/or previous attempts.

\subsection*{Tablet Interface}
A tablet oriented (or tablet compatible) user interface which can provide a child with simulated challenges around writing musical notation and easily allow them to input their attempts and display feedback.

\subsection*{Engaging Experience For Child}
Combine the two objectives above to produce a streamlined experience which a child will happily engage with on a repeat basis

\subsection*{Learning Improvement}
Produce a application which improves on and encourages a child's learning outside of lessons
