\subsection{Segmentation}

Why won't projection segmentation work for us? Want to be able to isolate stems and beams, projection segmentation only gives vertical sections


\subsection{Feature Extraction}

\subsubsection{Run Length Encoding}
To improve the speed of my application, I utilised \acrfull{RLE} (covered in \cref{sec:tb-rle}) to improve storage and retrieval times during feature extraction and classification by up to 97\%.

Testing with a sample set of 3000 stored components, improvements in storage and runtime are noted in table \cref{table:rle-improvement}

\begin{table}[h]

    \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{ X X X X }
    \toprule
    Metric                  & Without RLE   & With RLE   & Improvement \\
    \midrule
    Storage Required        & 759 MB        & 22 MB      & 91.7\%      \\
    Retrieval Time          & 1639 ms       & 42 ms      & 97.4\% \\
    \bottomrule
    \end{tabularx}

    \label{table:rle-improvement}
    \caption{Improvements after implementing RLE}
\end{table}

\subsection{Classification}
\label{sec:implementation-classification}

Classifiers are created by taking a sets of previously labelled samples and building a model which attempts to provide the most accurate relation between the samples and their labels.

This allows new samples to be classified using the model to apply the most likely (and hopefully correct) label.

\subsubsection{K Nearest Neighbour}
