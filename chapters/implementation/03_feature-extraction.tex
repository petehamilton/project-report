\subsection{Run Length Encoding}
To improve the speed of my application, I utilised \emph{run length encoding} which was covered in more detail in section \ref{sec:tb-rle} to improve storage and processing times by up to 97\%. Testing with a sample set of 3000 stored components, improvements in storage and runtime are noted in table \ref{table:rle-improvement}

\begin{table}[h]
\begin{tabular*}{\textwidth}{@{}l@{\extracolsep{\fill}}lll@{}}
Metric                  & Before RLE    & After RLE   & Improvement \\
\hline
Storage Required (MB)   & 759           & 22          & 91.7\%      \\
Retrieval Time (ms)     & 1639          & 42          & 97.4\%
\end{tabular*}
