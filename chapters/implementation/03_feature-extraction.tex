\section{Feature Extraction}

\subsection{Run Length Encoding}
To improve the speed of my application, I utilised \acrfull{RLE} (covered in section \ref{sec:tb-rle}) to improve storage and processing times by up to 97\%.

Testing with a sample set of 3000 stored components, improvements in storage and runtime are noted in table \ref{table:rle-improvement}

\begin{table}[h]
\begin{tabular*}{\textwidth}{@{}l@{\extracolsep{\fill}}lll@{}}
Metric                  & Without RLE   & With RLE   & Improvement \\
\hline
Storage Required        & 759 MB        & 22 MB      & 91.7\%      \\
Retrieval Time          & 1639 ms       & 42 ms      & 97.4\%
\end{tabular*}
