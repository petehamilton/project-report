\subsection{Capturing Strokes}

\subsection{Storing Data}

- Mention downsampling/scaling/normalizing via resize and the research into the best size

\subsection{Retrieving Data}

- Using HTML5 Canvas

- Draw lines by using X/Y positions, collecting the points and drawing straight lines between them

Considered using splines to better mimic the curves as at rapid speeds it can look a bit ``polygon-y''
Discovered in user testing that people drew slow, this wasn't a problem

Store JSON/point representation vs whole image

Whole image because:

- Fast server processing (generating versions)
- Most accurate representation of what the user sees (maybe?)
- Since eventual image evaluation takes place on pixels, generating these pixels every time an image is examined isn't great

JSON would have been good if:
I'd used stroke detection or gestures
I needed to re-render entities on the client side (I don't because I split them up and render separate components)

- Multiple Layers to extract the drawing
